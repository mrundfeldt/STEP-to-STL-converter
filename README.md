This project is a small python-based STEP to STL converter. It was born out of the need to transform STEP files from CAD systems into STL files for 3d-printing slicers. This is now largely unneccessary, as modern slicers parse STEPs internally.

I'm still putting it on here to keep myself accountable for my work and learn more about making code usable for other people than myself - especially regarding documentation.
